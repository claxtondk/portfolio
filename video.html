   I’ve always been fascinated by capybaras, so featuring them in my educational video was a natural choice. My goal was to mimic the style of old-school nature documentaries, while respecting the time constraints of the project. Since my computer doesn't have Movie Maker, I edited the video using Canva, which allowed me to easily arrange images, videos, and text into a cohesive final product.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">To gather the materials for my video, I sourced HD images and videos from Pexels. For the background music, I turned to Incompetech, where I found a track that reminded me of the ambiance in nature documentaries. However, the music was much longer than needed, and the beginning was too quiet, so I used an online platform to trim the track and select the perfect portion for my video. I also adjusted the volume of both the music and narration. I turned down the music so it didn’t overpower the narration, and I lowered the narration slightly so that viewers would have more control over the audio levels.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Once the audio was in place, I moved around the images and videos to match the flow of the narration. I also adjusted the timers of each clip, making sure they aligned with the script. To further enhance the visuals, I added "on enter" animations to some images and included transitions between clips. Although I couldn’t adjust the intensity of these animations due to Canva’s limitations, I was still able to achieve the desired effect. For the intro, I chose a panning clip, which I thought was a strong way to start the video. I also added captions to two clips, which complemented the narration. To ensure the text was legible, I applied a shadow effect.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">I was pleased with the final result, as I feel it captures the essence of the topic and effectively communicates the information in a creative way.
