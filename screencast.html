For my screencast tutorial on how to make a digital flipbook using Google Slides, I experimented with a program called ClipChamp, which was new to me and came with my device. Before starting, I ensured the software had screencasting capabilities, and it met all my needs, except for the zoom feature, which led me to finish my editing in Canva.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">I used a Google Slides document I had previously created to quickly recreate the project for the screencast. Initially, the video was 30 minutes long, but I decided to cut down the length by splitting and deleting clips, especially the parts where I referenced the original document. I also sped up repetitive actions, eventually reducing the length to just under four minutes.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Once I had the necessary footage, I added transitions to smooth the flow. I started with a title animation, overlayed it on some b-roll footage, and faded it into the tutorial’s beginning. I ended the tutorial by fading out to show the finished result. Since ClipChamp’s zoom effect didn’t meet my expectations, I used Canva’s zoom feature, despite being unsatisfied with the quality, to meet the rubric’s requirements.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">In Canva, I added additional animations, such as boxes highlighting key areas on the screen, to guide the viewer’s attention. I also sourced background music from Canva, adjusting its volume to a low level (5) and adding fade-ins and fade-outs to maintain focus on the narration. To record the voiceover, I used an external platform and synced it with the visuals in Canva.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Finally, I uploaded the screencast to YouTube and updated my portfolio. Despite some technical challenges with zooming and editing, the final product turned out to be an effective and visually engaging tutorial that helped me learn new tools and refine my video editing skills.</p>
