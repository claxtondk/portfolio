   This project allowed me to explore and apply HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in ways I hadn’t before. Though I had heard of these tools, I had no experience with them, so I began by learning the basics. The ability to select fun and personally meaningful topics made the learning process more enjoyable and motivating, pushing me toward the finish line. I worked on two related quizzes, each requiring its own unique set of modifications and problem-solving strategies.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">For the first quiz, I focused on improving the layout and visual design. I began by making several changes to the HTML structure, such as updating the title, changing the background color, and adjusting the button placements. I also changed the font to Quicksand and used a capybara GIF at the top of the page to give the quiz a more engaging, personalized touch. The design improvements included adjusting the quiz title’s size, changing its color, and adding a shadow effect. Additionally, I altered the "correct response" prompts in the JavaScript to play on the word "capybara," further reflecting the theme. These modifications were made with the goal of improving both the visual appeal and user interaction.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">For the second quiz, I made more structural and functionality changes. I increased the number of boxes from 3 to 4, updated the instructions and title, and centered elements within the HTML. I adjusted the container dimensions to better fit the quiz elements and changed the background color to black for contrast. The draggable items were adjusted with new colors and sizes, and I added images for a more dynamic appearance. I also made functional improvements like ensuring each draggable item was correctly rooted to its respective box and made the text white to stand out against the darker background. After implementing these changes, I felt more confident in my ability to design interactive web elements.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Both projects provided valuable hands-on experience with web design, allowing me to experiment with layout, functionality, and personalization. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m excited to continue building on these skills as I move forward in the course.
