   This first project was a great jumping-off point for the course. I selected a topic that was meaningful to me and created something I was truly proud of. Although it took time to complete, I was happy with the results.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">First, I reimagined a cover for Open Throat by Henry Hoke, told from the perspective of a lonely mountain lion living near the Hollywood sign. I envisioned the sky fading into the bottom of the main image or into black, symbolizing either a deceptively open sky or the story’s underlying darkness. I styled the reviews to evoke “bloody” imagery, using a font inspired by the Hollywood sign. I also added a small mountain lion to the “T” in the sign, making it almost indistinguishable to represent the character’s ability to stay hidden for years. Additionally, I included a tent and campfire to symbolize a pivotal homeless encampment in the story.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Next, I designed a logo for an imaginary cat food company featuring simple ingredients and novel proteins. I aimed for simplicity while conveying ruggedness to reflect the clean, unique ingredients. Inspired by a class-provided resource on minimalism and integrating design into text, I avoided using vibrant colors. Instead, I opted for texture, choosing a worn gray that suited the brand.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Overall, this project taught me how to bring meaning into design elements. It challenged me to think critically about aesthetics while aligning visuals with a narrative or brand identity. I’m pleased with how these pieces turned out and feel they effectively communicate their intended themes.
