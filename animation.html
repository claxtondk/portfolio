 Creating my animation on sperm whales and their use of echolocation was both a rewarding and challenging experience. I started by drawing the whale and background as separate layers in Adobe Animate, carefully outlining the whale and filling it with color. For the background, I used an existing gradient to add depth, then drew and filled seaweed to give the scene more life. Once the whale was complete, I duplicated its layers to set it on the intended path, and I did the same for the background layers, merging them once I was happy with the movement.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">Next, I exported the animation as a collection of images to import into Canva, where I enhanced the animation. I added the sound waves and fish, both sourced directly from Canva, and adjusted the frame duration to ensure the animation stayed under 15 seconds. To create a dynamic effect, I alternated frames to make the whaleâ€™s eyes blink and moved the fish along the frames to simulate it being eaten by the whale. I cropped the fish to make it look like it was being consumed as part of the animation.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">The audio was recorded separately and imported into Canva, where I adjusted its position to sync with the animation. To make the clip more informative, I added an image of a sperm whale skull, positioned it on top of my drawing, and faded it in for a seamless transition. The sound effects, including a bubble sound at the end of the clip, were lowered in volume to keep the focus on the narration.

		</p><p style="text-align: center">I finished the project by adding opening and closing text with transition animations. While I faced many challenges with the program, such as mastering the path and timing, the process of blending both animation and audio was ultimately rewarding. The final product was an educational yet visually engaging clip, and it deepened my understanding of both animation and sperm whale behavior.
