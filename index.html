  My name is Danielle, and I am excited to share my EME 6208 journey with you! I started my career as a classroom teacher in 2015.  I did that for seven years, and while the students were easily the most rewarding part, I found that the resources that I used and created to teach these students had a special place in my heart as well.  I felt a pull to explore Educational Technology in a more formal way.  Since leaving the classroom, I've had the honor to work for multiple EdTech companies as a freelancer.  I hope to one day design curriculum for one of these companies in a full-time role.  Everything I knew was self-taught, and sometimes the clumsier path was taken to get my desired results.  I applied for this new course of study to hone these skills.</p><p style="text-align: center">Since starting this program this semester, I have learned an unfathomable amount about Educational Technology.    Throughout my time in this course specifically, I really got the hands-on practice that I have been seeking for years.  I have learned many valuable lessons about design and development. This ePortfolio exists to display these skills. You will find artifacts related to image editing, web design, video production, and digital animation.

					<h2>E-Portfolio</h2>
					<p>This ePortfolio is a reflection of the skills I have acquired in design and development.  Although it was new territory, this course was definitely engaging and enlightening.  I am more than excited to take what I have learned and build on it.  I feel empowered with what I now know that I can do with design.
